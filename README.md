This is an interactive Python application that lets users search, enqueue, and manage songs in real-time using the YouTube Music API (ytmusicapi). Built with object-oriented design, it features a custom Song class and a queue data structure supporting core operations like enqueue, dequeue, peek, and clear. The system handles time conversions for consistent duration tracking and ensures playback continuity by storing session history in an integrated SQLite database, allowing users to view recently played tracks across multiple sessions.
